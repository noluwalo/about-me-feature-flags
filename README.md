# LaunchDarkly & Segment Analytics Demo - About Me Page

A Flask-based "About Me" demo application showcasing **LaunchDarkly feature flags** and **Segment Analytics integration**, with personalized experiences for different user roles (Recruiter vs Teammate).

## üéØ Features

- **LaunchDarkly Feature Flags**:
  - `type-writer-animation`: Boolean flag to toggle typewriter animation effect
  - `mode-toggle`: Multi-variate flag to switch between Professional (Recruiter) and Fun (Teammate) modes
  - `dynamic-content-widget`: A/B test for "Surprise Me!" button - serves either book recommendations or fun facts
  - `show-debug-panel`: Demo-only debug panel (not a production flag, just for visualization)

- **Segment Analytics Integration & Metrics**:
  - Real-time event tracking for all user interactions
  - User identification with auto-generated profiles
  - Custom event properties for detailed analytics
  - **Why Segment?** Acts as a data hub that captures events and forwards them to LaunchDarkly for experiment metrics, plus other destinations (Google Analytics, etc.)
  - Use Segment-tracked events to create metrics and run experiments in LaunchDarkly

- **Role-Based Experiences**:
  - Professional mode for Recruiters with career highlights
  - Fun mode for Teammates with personal interests

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A LaunchDarkly account (free tier available at [launchdarkly.com](https://launchdarkly.com))

```bash
export SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY='your-segment-write-key-here'
```

Or in **`app.py` (line 127)**, you can hardcode it temporarily for testing:
```python
segment_key = os.environ.get('SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY', 'YOUR-WRITE-KEY-HERE')
```

#### c) Connect Segment to LaunchDarkly for Metrics (Extra Credit)

This integration allows Segment events to power LaunchDarkly experiment metrics.

**Step 1: Get LaunchDarkly Client-side ID**
1. In LaunchDarkly, go to **Account settings** ‚Üí **Projects** ‚Üí Your project
2. Select your environment (e.g., Production, Test)
3. Copy the **Client-side ID** (starts with a random string like `63a1e2b3c4d5e6f7`)

**Step 2: Add LaunchDarkly Destination in Segment**
1. In Segment, go to **Connections** ‚Üí **Catalog**
2. Search for **"LaunchDarkly (Actions)"** and click it
3. Click **Configure LaunchDarkly (Actions)**
4. Select your JavaScript source (the one tracking events)
5. Click **Next** and name it (e.g., "LaunchDarkly Metrics")
6. Paste your **LaunchDarkly Client-side ID** from Step 1
7. Click **Create Destination**

**Step 3: Map Track Events to Metrics**
1. In the LaunchDarkly destination settings, click **Mappings** tab
2. Click **New Mapping** ‚Üí Select **Track Event** action
3. Configure the field mappings as follows:

| Segment Field | LaunchDarkly Field | Mapping | Example Value |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| `event` | Event Name | `{{ event }}` | "Surprise Clicked" |
| `userId` | Email | `{{ userId }}` | "agvbsdbrtf@example.com" |
| `anonymousId` | Context Key | `{{ anonymousId }}` | "7c42798e-10c1-4a70-838a-58a8cdbf5754" |
| (fixed value) | Context Kind | `user` | "user" |
| `properties.variant` | AB variant | `{{ properties.variant }}` | "books" |
| `properties.clicks` | Variant clicks | `{{ properties.clicks }}` | 11 |

4. Click **Save**

**Result:** When a `Surprise Clicked` event fires in Segment, LaunchDarkly receives:
```json
{
    "Event Name": "Surprise Clicked",
    "Email": "agvbsdbrtf@example.com",
    "Context Kind": "user",
    "AB variant": "books",
    "Variant clicks": 11
}
```

**Step 4: Create Metrics in LaunchDarkly**
1. In LaunchDarkly, go to **Metrics** ‚Üí **Create metric**
2. Create a metric with these settings:
   - **Name**: "Surprise Button Clicks"
   - **Event kind**: Custom
   - **Event name**: `Surprise Clicked` (MUST match Segment event name exactly)
   - **Metric type**: Custom conversion (count)
   - **Success criteria**: Higher is better
3. Click **Save metric**

**Step 5: Attach Metric to Experiment**
1. Go to your `dynamic-content-widget` flag
2. Click **Experiments** tab ‚Üí **Create experiment**
3. Select your "Surprise Button Clicks" metric
4. Set hypothesis: "Fun facts increase engagement vs books"
5. Click **Start recording**

**Step 6: Verify Integration**
1. Interact with the app (click "Surprise Me!" button)
2. Check Segment **Debugger** - you should see `Surprise Clicked` events
3. Check LaunchDarkly **Metrics** dashboard - events should appear within 1-2 minutes
4. View experiment results showing click rates per variation

**Important Field Mapping Rules:**
- ‚úÖ Segment `event name` MUST exactly match LaunchDarkly `metric event key`
- ‚úÖ Segment `userId` or `anonymousId` must match LaunchDarkly context key
- ‚úÖ In this project: `Surprise Clicked` event ‚Üí `Surprise Clicked` metric
- ‚úÖ Track events include properties like `variant` and `clicks` for richer analysis

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
# Option 1: Using Flask directly (development)
python app.py

# Option 2: Using Gunicorn (production-like)
gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port app:app
```

The app will be available at: **http://localhost:5000**

You can now use it the same way as described in the "How to Use the Live Demo" section above!

## üîç What to Test

### Part 1: Boolean Feature Flag
- **Typewriter Animation**: Toggle `type-writer-animation` flag ON/OFF in LaunchDarkly to see animated vs static text

### Part 2: Multi-variate Flag with Targeting
- **Mode Toggle**: The `mode-toggle` flag serves different modes based on user role:
  - Recruiters see "professional" mode with career highlights
  - Teammates see "fun" mode with personal interests

### Part 3: A/B Experiment
- **Dynamic Content Widget**: The `dynamic-content-widget` flag powers an A/B test:
  - Variation "books" ‚Üí Shows book recommendations when clicking "Surprise Me!"
  - Variation "fun-facts" ‚Üí Shows fun facts when clicking "Surprise Me!"
- **Hypothesis**: Fun facts increase engagement more than book recommendations
- **Metric**: Track click count via Segment events

### Segment Analytics & Metrics
1. Go to your Segment **Debugger** page
2. Submit the form and interact with the app
3. You should see tracked events:
   - `User Submitted Form`
   - `Mode Toggle Clicked`
   - `Surprise Clicked` (with variant and click count)
4. These events flow to LaunchDarkly for experiment metrics

**Data Flow:**
```
User clicks "Surprise Me!" 
  ‚Üí Segment tracks event: "Surprise Clicked" with {variant: "books", clicks: 3}
  ‚Üí Event sent to LaunchDarkly (Actions) destination
  ‚Üí LaunchDarkly metric receives event
  ‚Üí Experiment dashboard updates with results per variation
  ‚Üí You see which variant (books vs fun-facts) drives more engagement!
```

## üîë Important Notes

### How User Identification Works
- Users enter their **name only** (no email input)
- The app auto-generates an email as `{name}@example.com` for Segment user profiles
- This allows Segment to track events and attach them to a user identity
- LaunchDarkly receives user context with name, role, and generated email

### LaunchDarkly Context
The app sends user context to LaunchDarkly with these attributes:
- `name`: User's name
- `role`: "recruiter" or "teammate" 
- `location`: User's location
- `interest`: User's interest

You can create custom targeting rules based on these attributes.

### Security
- **Never commit API keys** to the repository
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Replace placeholder SDK keys in:
  - **`app.py` line 27**: LaunchDarkly SDK key
  - **`app.py` line 127**: Segment Write Key (via environment variable)
- For production, use proper secret management

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### LaunchDarkly Connection Issues
- Check that your SDK key is correct in `app.py` line 27
- Verify the SDK initialized successfully (check console logs: `‚úÖ SDK successfully initialized`)
- Ensure feature flags exist in LaunchDarkly with exact key names (case-sensitive)

### Segment Not Tracking
- Verify your `SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check browser console for Segment initialization messages: `‚úÖ Segment Analytics initialized`
- Go to Segment Debugger to see real-time events
- Make sure events show the correct properties (variant, clicks, role, etc.)

### Flags Not Updating
- Refresh the page after changing flags in LaunchDarkly
- Check LaunchDarkly Live Events to see flag evaluations in real-time
- Verify targeting rules aren't blocking the flag (check user context attributes)

### A/B Test Not Working
- Ensure `dynamic-content-widget` flag has variations "books" and "fun-facts"
- Check that targeting/rollout is set up correctly (try 50/50 split)
- Verify Segment events are tracking the correct variant
